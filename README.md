# Console Finances

1. Created a new repository and added starter code.
2. In starter code we have a variable which is assigned to object.
3. Calculated total number of months in the given object using .length property.
4. Calculated net total amount of profit/loss in the entire period using for loop.
5. Calculated average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period by using  for and if loops. (Total/(Number of months - 1))
6. Calculate greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period by declaring a varible and storing the solved value in other variable and continued the loop.
7. Calculated greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period in the same process as above.
